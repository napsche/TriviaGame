This application was built using JavaScript and jQuery and styled using CSS. The purpose of this assignment was to demonstrate the use of a timer on a basic questionarre. Once the "Start" button is clicked, an array of questions is displayed for the user to answer within the allotted amount of time. If the timer runs out, the results will show to the user as long as a notification letting them know that they have run out of time. 

Give it a try!
